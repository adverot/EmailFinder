# EmailFinder

A powerful and intelligent Node.js tool to discover the email address of a person based on their name and company domain. It uses a sophisticated scoring system to test the most plausible email formats first, saving time and increasing efficiency.

## Features

*   **Smart Email Generation**: Creates a comprehensive list of possible email formats from a first name and last name.
*   **Plausibility Scoring**: Each generated email is assigned a score based on its likelihood, ensuring that common formats like `f.lastname@domain.com` are tested before more obscure ones.
*   **Catch-All Detection**: Automatically checks if a domain accepts all incoming emails (a "catch-all" server) to avoid false positives and save time.
*   **Robust Name Normalization**: Handles complex names gracefully, including accents (`Jérôme`), apostrophes (`O'Neil`), and various compound name separators (`-`, ` `, `--`).
*   **TOR Integration Ready**: Can be easily run through the TOR network using `torsocks` for IP address rotation and anonymization.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18+ recommended)
*   (Optional) TOR and `torsocks` for anonymization.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adverot/EmailFinder
    cd emailfinder
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1.  Open the `index.js` file.

2.  Modify the example usage block at the bottom of the file with the details of the person you are looking for:

    ```javascript
    // --- Example Usage ---
    (async () => {
        // Replace with the details of the person you are looking for
        const email = await findEmail("Jérôme", "O'Neil", "gmail.com");
        console.log("\n--- All Done! ---");
        console.log("Final result:", email);
    })();
    ```

3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

### Usage with TOR

To protect your IP address and avoid potential rate-limiting, you can run the script through the TOR network.

1.  Make sure the TOR service is running on your machine.

2.  Prefix the run command with `torsocks`:
    ```bash
    torsocks node index.js
    ```
    The script will now route all its network requests through TOR, using a different IP address for the outside world.

## Understanding the Output

The script will log its progress in the console and can have one of three final results:

*   **A valid email address (string)**:
    ```
    SUCCESS! Found valid email: bill.gates@microsoft.com
    --- All Done! ---
    Final result: bill.gates@microsoft.com
    ```

*   **"Catch-all"**:
    ```
    WARNING! Domain example.com appears to be a catch-all. Aborting.
    --- All Done! ---
    Final result: Catch-all
    ```

*   **`null`**:
    ```
    FAILED! Could not find a valid email.
    --- All Done! ---
    Final result: null
    ```

## Project Structure

*   `index.js`: The main engine of the application. It handles the catch-all check and orchestrates the SMTP verification process using the emails generated by `recompose.js`.
*   `recompose.js`: The "brain" of the project. This module is responsible for normalizing names and generating a comprehensive, scored, and sorted list of potential email addresses based on a sophisticated plausibility algorithm.
